# LibrarySoftwareProject
This is a basic servlet-based full-stack application designed to have all the basic functionality required in a library setting. I created this as a school project in college

This application is lacking a pretty frontend and that is because this was created for a Java class. I may work on updating the frontend to make it prettier in the future but it is not currently a priority of mine
